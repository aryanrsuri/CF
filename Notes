cin is powerful, it will parse out the type of the variable you use to grba it, i.e there is a matrix in multiple lines
you can use 

```
 int value, r = 0, c = 0;
  for (size_t i = 0; i <= 4; ++i) {
    for (size_t j = 0; j <= 4; ++j) {
      cin >> value;
      if (value == 1) {
        r = i;
        c = j;
      }
    }
  }
```

Things that are trivial in python, c++ has non-trival solutions for, here is the way of converting a std::string to lowercase

```
  std::transform(a.begin(), a.end(), a.begin(),
                 [](unsigned char c) { return std::tolower(c); });
 ```

Essentially get the ints as a vector, sort in ascending order, then output with '+' in between each char

Coversion of a char[] (string) to a set<char> 

```
  std::set<char> ch(s.begin(), s.end());
```

a,b a<=b 
da/dy = 3*a
db/dy = 2*b

y? = a > b

simple calculate weight y on y until a > b

set prev to be first char in s ; loop through s ; if curr == prev then count++ ; if count > 7 cout YES else NO;
