Here’s a structured roadmap to take you from “company‐style” coding into true competitive programming mastery—whether your goal is Codeforces “Master” or simply feeling at home solving any tricky algorithmic problem under time pressure.

## 1. Mindset & Problem-Solving Approach

1. **Read & Understand Carefully**

   * Parse what’s being asked: inputs, outputs, constraints.
   * Identify what “type” of problem it is (e.g. graph, DP, math…) before coding.

2. **Brute-Force First, Optimize Later**

   * Sketch a naïve solution.
   * Check feasibility vs. constraints (`n`, `q`, time limit).

3. **Divide and Conquer**

   * Break a hard problem into subproblems.
   * Tackle each subproblem in isolation.

4. **Pattern Recognition**

   * After solving, tag the problem by technique (e.g. “tree DP,” “two pointers,” “modular math”).
   * When you see a new problem, scan your mental library of patterns.

5. **Time & Stress Management**

   * Simulate contest conditions: 1–2 h with no editor help.
   * Learn to “skip and return” if stuck for >10 min.

## 4. Guided Coursework & Practice Plan

### **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4): Foundations**

1. **Implement From Scratch:**

   * Sorting (quick, merge), binary search, two pointers
   * DSU, basic BFS/DFS
2. **Problems:** 100 easy (“800–1000” on CF)
3. **Goal:** Solve in <20 min each.

### **Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8): Core DS\&A**

1. **Learn & Code:**

   * Fenwick/Segment trees, priority queues, hash tables
   * Dijkstra, simple tree-DP
2. **Problems:** 80 medium (“1200–1400” on CF)
3. **Contests:** Start doing one virtual CF/AtCoder Beginner every other day.

### **Phase 3 (Weeks 9–16): Advanced Techniques**

1. **Topics:**

   * Bitmask DP, string algos (KMP, Z), LCA, MST, DSU on tree
   * Intro to flows (Dinic)
2. **Problems:** 60 hard (“1600–1800” on CF)
3. **Contests:** Regular participation (3–4 per week), review editorials.

### **Phase 4 (Weeks 17+): Polish & Mastery**

1. **Advanced Topics:**

   * FFT, centroid decomposition, persistent segtrees, combinatorial game theory
2. **Problems:** Target “2000+” CF problems, track weak areas.
3. **Peak Tuning:**

   * Take part in CF Div 1+2 rounds.
   * Do “UpSolve” after every contest: code every unsolved problem.

## 5. Practice Tools & Habits

* **Problem-Tag Spreadsheet:** Track solved problems by tag & difficulty.
* **Time Logging:** Use a simple timer to record how long you spend per problem.
* **Code Library:** Maintain tested snippets for DS\&A (Fenwick, DSU, binary search templates).
* **Peer Review:** Join Discord/Telegram CP groups; compare solutions.
* **Blitz Sessions:** 30 min to solve 3 random “1200–1500” problems.

---

## 6. Taking It Further

* **Team Contests:** ICPC‐style team practice to learn collaboration under time.
* **Write Your Own Contests:** Curate problem sets for friends; teaches problem design.
* **Algorithm Research:** Read recent CP blogs for new tricks (e.g. “Mo’s algorithm on trees,” “Divide‐and‐Color,” etc.).
* **Teaching:** Writing tutorials or making videos cements your understanding.

By following this roadmap—layering theory, drilling problems by topic and difficulty, simulating contest conditions, and steadily increasing challenge—you’ll develop both the toolkit and the intuition to think like a top‐tier competitive programmer. Good luck on your journey to “master” rating!
